## Machine Learning Interactive Visualization

An interactive dashboard for visualizing machine learning model evaluation metrics. The dashboard allows users to adjust parameters like class imbalance, model strength, and cutoff values, and observe the effects on metrics such as ROC/AUC, accuracy, precision, and recall. The dashboard is built using Jupyter and Voila, and is available live online.
